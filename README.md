## Project Overview
The **Emoji Predictor** is an RNN-based machine learning model that classifies text into emoji categories, representing the underlying sentiment or topic of the text with an emoji. This is achieved using a two-layer LSTM model trained on GloVe embeddings to capture semantic relationships in text.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of a CSV file (`emoji_text.csv`) where:
- Column 0 (`X`) contains phrases or sentences.
- Column 1 (`Y`) contains numeric labels corresponding to emojis:
  - `0`: ‚ù§Ô∏è (Red Heart)
  - `1`: ‚öæ (Baseball)
  - `2`: üòÄ (Grinning Face with Big Eyes)
  - `3`: üòû (Disappointed Face)
  - `4`: üçΩÔ∏è (Fork and Knife with Plate)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Emoji
